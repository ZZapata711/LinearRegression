In this project, I am taking the Ecommerce dataset found on Kaggle.com and performing a Linear Regression 
in order to answer the question of whether the store should focus on improving either their Mobile App or Website.

We can use a linear regression in order find out which of these features has a stronger positive association with the
amount of money a given customer might spend in a year using data which stores the amount of time a given customer
spends on either the website or mobile app.
